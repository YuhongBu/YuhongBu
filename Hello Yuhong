// Hello everybody !
// Welcome to my space !

// Some folders are private, they are aimed at saving some important data.
// C++ Training and Programing make me happy (obviously).
// You can follow my private instagram @brock_bu to see some photos that I took. 
// They are quite beautiful.
// Due to some issues, I could not update my social account daily. It could be worked out in Spring 2021.

// Finally, special thanks to Prof. Haiyang Chao from Kansas University, who bring me to the world of C++.
// Practice ! Practice ! Practice ! Work hard !
// So, enjoy it !
